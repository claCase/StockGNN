    - Remove non business days from dataset
        - Basic removal: day_of_week < 5
        - Advanced removal taking into account timezone
    - To matrix
2) Develop training pipeline with DatasetGenerator keras
3) Make model.save functional
4) Transform computation to float16
5) Add Time Embeddings
6)
